Snowpipe is a powerful continuous data ingestion service provided by Snowflake, a leading cloud-based data warehousing platform. It enables users to effortlessly load streaming data into Snowflake data warehouses in near real-time, facilitating timely analysis and decision-making. Snowpipe seamlessly integrates with various external data sources, including cloud storage platforms like Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Snowpipe provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities, allowing users to track the status of data ingestion processes in real-time. It also supports alerting mechanisms to notify users of any issues or failures during the ingestion process.

About the Data:
The data is taken from a publicly available dataset. This dataset signifies the per hour usage of electricity by electrical appliances in a house for 350 days. I applied some transformation logics to aggregate the data using Python. Divided the files into 5 equal segments to demostrate continuous loading process.
